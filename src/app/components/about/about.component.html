        <h3 class="text-brown">Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Coffee isn’t just a drink — it’s a **ritual** that brings us together. At Coffee Bliss, we believe every cup should tell a story, every sip should feel like a connection, and every visit should bring joy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
          From the first bean to the final pour, we craft coffee with care and purpose. We’re here to do more than serve you coffee — we want to offer you a **moment of warmth** in your busy day, a space where you can relax, unwind, and **connect with others**.
        </p>

       <h3 class="text-brown mt-4">Our Vision</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          At **Coffee Bliss**, our vision is to create a space that goes beyond just great coffee. We strive to be a place where the **community comes together**, where conversations flow, and where every cup is crafted with care. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
          We see a future where our shop is not just a café, but a **community hub**, where relationships are fostered, and our customers feel at home. We want to be a part of your everyday life — whether it’s your quiet morning ritual or a place to meet friends.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-brown mt-4">Our Mission</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Our mission is simple: to create a place where **quality** coffee, **sustainability**, and **community** come together. We focus on ethically sourced beans, sustainable practices, and a warm, inviting environment that encourages people to slow down, chat, and connect.
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted fst-italic">
          **Coffee** is more than just fuel — it’s a way to bring people together, one cup at a time.
